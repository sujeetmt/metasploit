We're having a Metasploit hackathon at the Rapid7 Austin Office Thursday 2016-09-15, starting at Noon (12pm) CST and going until 10am CST the following day.

Got a cool Meterpreter extension you have wanted to try, module to write, or feature to add? We'll be working both on new things and shepherding old-but-awesome things. Come join us on #metasploit on Freenode as well.
