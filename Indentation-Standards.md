Using **two-space soft tabs**, and not hard tabs, is the second precept<sup>*</sup> of the [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#source-code-layout). This convention is widely adopted by nearly all Ruby projects, including Metasploit.

This page used to have a long, boring discussion about tabs vs. spaces, and the process used to convert Metasploit to a Ruby standard tabbing scheme. That was completed in mid-October of 2013.
